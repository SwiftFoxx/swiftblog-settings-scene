# Building a Settings Scene

This repository contains a focused demonstration of how to design and build a **Settings scene** in SwiftUI with long-term scalability in mind. The goal of this project is to showcase patterns that make settings screens easy to extend, refactor, and maintain as an application grows.

The implementation emphasizes **reusable view components**, shared logic, and a clear separation of concerns. By structuring the code thoughtfully, the Settings scene remains flexible and avoids the common pitfalls of tightly coupled views and hard-to-scale state handling.

The project follows a modern **MVVM architecture**, ensuring predictable data flow, testable logic, and views that remain simple and declarative. This makes it easier to reason about changes, introduce new settings, and adapt the scene to different product requirements.
